Making an appointment means

* Add date, time and title of the appointment to the Android-Calendar
* In Android-Calendar-Detailview use Send/Share (from menu or toolbar)
* Select "CalEF" as share destination (to convert to human readable text)
* Select the final Send/Share destination (clipboard, sms, mail, ...)

Usually calendar entries are shared in a human-unreadable technical format
"ICS" (or "VCS") that calendar programs can read.

CalEF receives the technical format and re-sends/re-shares it-s content as human readable text.

Date/Time is formatted according to current language/locale.

CalEF can also process "ics" (or "vcs") files (i.e. from a calendar backup).
