Select an entry in Android-Calendar and send/share the entry's content as human readable text.

Usually calendar entries are shared in human-unreadable technical format "ICS" (or "VCS") that
calendar programs can read.

CalEF receives the technical format and re-sends/re-shares it-s content as human readable text.
